# Alfredo Lanzetta ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the digital world!

I'm Alfredo Lanzetta, co-founder, and Chief Technology Officer at [Mapotapo](https://www.mapotapo.com), where we're cooking up some exciting innovations! I've spent the last 7 years knee-deep in the ecommerce world, navigating its twists and turns, and picking up a ton of insights along the way.

I'm all about building solid tech foundations, writing clean code, and automating anything and everything that comes my way. From tweaking user experiences to scaling solutions, I've seen it all in the ecommerce game, and it's been quite the ride!

Currently, I'm focused on diving into cutting-edge technologies such as generative AI and cloud architectures, with the aim of sharpening my skills as an architect. My appetite for learning and growth keeps me on the lookout for fresh challenges and opportunities to broaden my horizons.

If you're into similar stuff or have some cool projects brewing, let's chat! Whether it's bouncing around ideas, geeking out over tech trends, or teaming up on a project, I'm all ears. Hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfredolanzetta/) and let's make some magic happen!
